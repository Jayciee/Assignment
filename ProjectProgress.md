### Introduction

This project is a Monster Hunter Journal based on the videogame series "Monster Hunter". The application is a journal that provides users with the ability to document "hunts" that they have attempted on monsters in the game. The purpose of these hunting records is to allow for users to review tactics that they have previously employed and compare the methods to determine of which are the most effective. Alternatively the application can also be used simply to document their experience and attempts with monster hunts.  

### Sprint 0

Sprint 0 consisted of preparing documentation for the project and general planning for the project. This mostly included preparing the Kanban board using GitHub and rough sketched ideas of what my project was going to be about. Below are visualisations of my ideas.

Mind map condensed into **Rough Ideas**, at this point I knew I wanted to do a Monster hunter journal.

To conclude sprint 0 I needed to decide what to do in my official sprint 1.
