### Introduction

This project is a Monster Hunter Journal based on the videogame series "Monster Hunter". The application is a journal that provides users with the ability to document "hunts" that they have attempted on monsters in the game. The purpose of these hunting records is to allow for users to review tactics that they have previously employed and compare the methods to determine of which are the most effective. Alternatively the application can also be used simply to document their experience and attempts with monster hunts.  

### Sprint 0

Sprint 0 consisted of preparing documentation for the project and general planning for the project. This mostly included preparing the Kanban board using GitHub and rough sketched ideas of what my project was going to be about. Below are visualisations of my ideas.

Mind map condensed into **Rough Ideas**, at this point I knew I wanted to do a Monster hunter journal.

To conclude sprint 0 I needed to decide what to do in my official sprint 1. 

### Sprint 1

The project goals for this sprint is to carry out the highest priority user stories for the project. In this case it is:

- The creation of the skeletion of my application
- Designing and intialising of the database. 

I have chosen to carry out these two tasks because a lot of user stories that I have defined are dependent on user stories that involve these two things.
I have made a slight change to the board: introducing an epics column for visual purposes, re-formatting the gherkin syntax to be more clear and adding the dependencies for the definition of ready to each user story again for visual clarity.
